    <li>Identify cases where your program doesn't behave according to spec, or where dangerous behavior may occur</li>
    <li>Fix the bugs in your program according to the docs from step 1</li>
    <li>Test your program against <code>gold</code> on the <a href="{{ url_for('test.create') }}">Test against Gold</a> page to make sure your fixes work</li>
    <li>Upload the fixed program according to the docs on the <a href="{{ url_for('program.store') }}">submit program page</a></li>
    <li>Create attacks against other teams' programs on the <a href="{{ url_for('attacks.create') }}">create attack page</a></li>
